Overview

Enjoy the convenience of being picked from your accommodations in Hide Ella Hotel & Resort via tuk-tuk. Begin your tour with an 
early morning hike to the famous cliff, Ella Rock. Along the way, you’ll journey through tranquil woodlands and tea plantations. 
Walk alongside the iconic Sri Lankan railroad. Once you’ve reached Ella Rock, you’ll be able to enjoy amazing panoramic views.
Hike down from Ella Rock to Nine Arches Bridge, a picturesque bridge which connects the Ella and Demodara railway stations. 
The bridge consists of 9 arches, which offer a harmonious sense of geometry against the lush green growth of the countryside. 
The bridge is made exclusively from rock, brick, and cement, and doesn’t use any steel. Stand underneath the bridge and look out into 
the beautiful “9 skies” framed by the 9 arches. Walk across the bridge and learn about its history from your knowledgable guide as you 
take in the surroundings. Sit down for lunch at a local restaurant before going for an afternoon hike to Little Adam’s Peak, 
Ella’s most well-known attraction. Enjoy an easy and gradual climb to the peak. Once there, take in a spectacular view of the 
Ella Gap. Walk through lush green tea plantations and paddy fields. See local people plucking and collecting tea leaves. Gaze 
over the valley into the island’s central highlands. Take a refreshing swig of complimentary bottled water. Your tour ends as 
you are returned to your hotel via tuk-tuk

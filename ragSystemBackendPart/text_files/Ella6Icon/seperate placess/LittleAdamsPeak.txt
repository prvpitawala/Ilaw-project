This document include little adams peak details and brief discription.

Deriving its name from its big brother, the sacred mountain Adam’s Peak, Little Adam’s Peak is 2243m above sea level. 
The trail to the mountain is fairly average and would require you to have a medium level of fitness. With marked paths, 
you’ll have to clamber through some narrow rocky areas to reach the summit. The view from the peak is definitely worth the arduous climb. 
There are a number of hotels located in the area to cater to the large number of tourists that visit the mountain. The ideal time to start 
your hike is either in the morning or late evening, when it isn’t to hot.

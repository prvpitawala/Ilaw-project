3. The Sahara Desert
The world's largest hot desert, covering most of North Africa. 
Its vast sand dunes, rocky plateaus, and extreme climate make survival difficult. 
Temperatures soar above 50°C, yet some resilient creatures and nomadic tribes thrive. 
It’s constantly expanding due to desertification, threatening nearby communities and ecosystems.

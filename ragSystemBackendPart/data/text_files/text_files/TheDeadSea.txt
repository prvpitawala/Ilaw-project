10. The Dead Sea
A hypersaline lake bordered by Jordan and Israel, famous for its extreme buoyancy. 
With a salt concentration ten times higher than normal seawater, 
it prevents marine life from thriving. Rich in minerals, its mud is used for skincare. 
Shrinking rapidly, it faces environmental challenges from water diversion.
